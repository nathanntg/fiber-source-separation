Fiber Source Separation
=======================

Models for simulating bundles of splaying microfibers as a deep brain optical
interface. Includes the ability to calculate sensitivity profiles for 
individual fibers, and interface properties for bundles of the fibers that 
have splayed through a target brain region.

Using non-negative independent component analysis (as described in 
"Algorithms for Nonnegative Independent Component Analysis" by Mark D. 
Plumbley), we demonstrate the ability to separate out individual neural 
contributes based on overlaps between the sensitivity profile for nearby 
fibers.

More documentation will follow.

Toy Source Separation Model
---------------------------

To see the output of the source separation technique, a toy model is 
included. To run, use the script `toy_source_separation`.
